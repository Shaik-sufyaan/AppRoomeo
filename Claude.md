# Project Brief: MyCrib Backend & Database Schema

## Context
I'm building a **roommate-finding mobile app** using Expo/React Native with the following features:
- **Chat**: Real-time messaging between potential roommates
- **Matches**: Swipe/browse potential roommates with matching algorithm
- **Marketplace**: List and browse furniture, items for sale/rent
- **Expenses**: Shared expense tracking and splitting between roommates
- **User Profiles**: Detailed profiles with preferences, lifestyle, budget

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: Expo Router + React Native (already built)
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL database, Auth, Storage, Real-time subscriptions)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth + Google OAuth
- **No external APIs**: All functionality through Supabase

## Project Goal
Create a complete Supabase backend with:
1. **Database schema** (tables, relationships, RLS policies)
2. **Database functions** (stored procedures for complex queries)
3. **Real-time subscriptions** setup for chat
4. **Storage buckets** configuration for images
5. **Integration code** for the React Native app

## Constraints & Requirements
- Use Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) for all tables
- Design for scalability (indexes on foreign keys and search fields)
- Follow PostgreSQL best practices
- Keep schema normalized (avoid data duplication)
- Use TypeScript for all integration code
- Include proper error handling
- Write migrations that can be rolled back

## Standard Workflow

### Phase 1: Planning (DO THIS FIRST)
1. **Read the existing codebase** to understand:
   - Current file structure (`app/`, `contexts/`, `types/`)
   - Existing type definitions
   - Current mock data structure
   - UI components and their data requirements

2. **Create `projectplan.md`** with:
   - **Overview**: High-level architecture summary
   - **Database Schema**: List all tables with fields and relationships
   - **File Structure**: New files/folders to create
   - **Task Checklist**: Granular todo items (check boxes `- [ ]`)
   - **Risk Assessment**: Potential issues or blockers

3. **STOP and wait for my approval** before proceeding

### Phase 2: Implementation (After approval)
Work through tasks **one at a time** in this order:

1. **Database Schema**
   - Create SQL migration files in `supabase/migrations/`
   - Include CREATE TABLE, indexes, foreign keys, RLS policies
   - Keep each migration focused (one concern per file)

2. **Database Functions**
   - Create stored procedures for complex queries
   - Functions for matching algorithm, search, etc.

3. **TypeScript Types**
   - Generate types from Supabase schema
   - Update existing types in `/types` folder

4. **Supabase Client Setup**
   - Create `lib/supabase.ts` with client initialization
   - Setup auth helpers

5. **Integration Functions**
   - Create API layer functions in `lib/api/`
   - Separate file per feature (chat, matches, marketplace, expenses)

6. **Update React Hooks**
   - Replace mock data with real Supabase queries
   - Use React Query for data fetching

### Phase 3: Communication Style

**For each task you complete:**
- ‚úÖ Check it off in `projectplan.md`
- Give me a **2-3 sentence summary** of what you did
- Example: "Created users table with RLS policies. Added indexes on email and location fields for faster queries. Set up foreign key to auth.users table."

**Keep changes minimal:**
- One task at a time
- Small, focused commits
- Avoid refactoring existing code unless necessary
- Don't change working code that doesn't need backend integration

**Before making large changes:**
- Explain what you're about to do
- Wait for confirmation if it affects more than 3 files

### Phase 4: Documentation & Review

When all tasks are complete, add to `projectplan.md`:

**## Review & Summary**
- ‚úÖ **Completed**: What was built
- üìã **Files Changed**: List of new/modified files
- üîß **Setup Instructions**: How to run migrations and configure Supabase
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Known Issues**: Any limitations or TODOs
- üìö **Next Steps**: Recommended follow-up work

**## Testing Checklist**
- [ ] All migrations run successfully
- [ ] RLS policies tested with different user roles
- [ ] Real-time subscriptions working
- [ ] File uploads to storage working
- [ ] Auth flow (signup, login, logout) tested

## Key Priorities
1. **Security First**: Every table must have RLS policies
2. **Simplicity**: Prefer simple solutions over clever ones
3. **Type Safety**: Generate and use TypeScript types
4. **Real-time Ready**: Design for real-time where needed (chat)
5. **Mobile Optimized**: Consider offline-first where possible

## Questions to Answer During Planning
- What are the core entities? (User, Match, Chat, Message, Listing, Expense, etc.)
- What are the relationships between them?
- Which tables need real-time updates?
- What queries will be most common? (optimize with indexes)
- What user roles exist? (regular user, admin, etc.)
- What data needs to be public vs private?

## Example Database Tables to Consider
- `profiles` - Extended user data beyond auth.users
- `matches` - Potential roommate matches
- `conversations` - Chat threads
- `messages` - Individual messages
- `listings` - Marketplace items
- `expenses` - Shared expenses
- `expense_splits` - Who owes what
- `preferences` - User matching preferences
- `swipes` - Like/dislike history

## Success Criteria
‚úÖ Database schema is complete and normalized
‚úÖ All tables have RLS policies
‚úÖ Migrations are tested and reversible
‚úÖ TypeScript types are generated
‚úÖ API functions are typed and working
‚úÖ Real-time chat is functional
‚úÖ Auth flow is complete
‚úÖ Documentation is clear
