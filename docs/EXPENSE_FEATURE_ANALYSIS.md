# Expense Feature - Complete Analysis

## 📊 Overview

Your expense tracking system is designed to help roommates split costs for shared living expenses and events. It's **currently using mock data** with no database integration yet.

---

## ✅ Features You Have Implemented

### 1. **Summary Dashboard (Top Cards)**

**What it shows:**
- **Money to Receive** (Green card with TrendingUp icon)
  - Total amount owed to you by all roommates
  - Calculated from all active rooms where you're the creator
  - Shows pending (unsettled) balances only

- **Money You Owe** (Red card with TrendingDown icon)
  - Total amount you owe to others
  - Currently shows `$0.00` (not fully implemented)
  - Should calculate balances where you're a participant

**Current State:** ⚠️ Partially working
- Only calculates money TO receive
- Missing calculation for money YOU owe
- Uses `balanceSummary` computed from `expenseRooms`

**Code Location:** `expenses/index.tsx:152-172`

---

### 2. **Create Room Feature**

**What it does:**
- Creates a shared expense group for recurring costs
- Example use cases: Monthly rent, groceries, utilities

**Two-Step Process:**

**Step 1: Basic Info**
- Room Name (required) - e.g., "Monthly Rent", "Groceries"
- Description (optional) - Additional details
- Total Amount (required) - e.g., $1200 for rent

**Step 2: Add People**
- Select roommates from your friends list
- Shows avatar, name, and age for each user
- Multi-select with checkboxes
- At least 1 person required

**What happens when created:**
```javascript
// Splits amount equally among all members
const perPersonAmount = totalAmount / allMembers.length;

// Example: $1200 rent split among 3 people = $400 each
// Creates balance records for everyone except creator
```

**Balances Created:**
- Each selected member gets a balance record
- Amount: `totalAmount / numberOfMembers`
- Status: `settled: false` (unpaid)
- **YOU (creator) are excluded** from owing money
- Others owe their share TO you

**Code Location:** `components/CreateRoomModal.tsx`

---

### 3. **Create Event Feature**

**What it does:**
- Creates a one-time group expense (e.g., weekend trip, birthday party)
- Events can contain multiple "rooms" for different expense categories

**Two-Step Process:**

**Step 1: Event Details**
- Event Name (required) - e.g., "Weekend Trip", "Birthday Party"
- Description (optional)
- Estimated Budget (required) - Total expected cost

**Step 2: Add Participants**
- Select people who will join the event
- Multi-select from friends list
- At least 1 person required

**Key Difference from Rooms:**
- Events are containers for multiple expense categories
- Budget is just an estimate (not split immediately)
- Can add multiple "rooms" under one event later
- More flexible for complex group activities

**Code Location:** `components/CreateEventModal.tsx`

---

**Code Location:** `expenses/index.tsx:273-291`

---

## 🎯 Data Flow & State Management

### Storage System
Uses `AppContext` with AsyncStorage (local persistence):
- `expenseRooms` - Array of all expense rooms
- `expenseEvents` - Array of all events
- Saves to device storage on changes
- Loads on app startup

### Key Functions

**`addExpenseRoom(room)`**
- Adds new room to state
- Persists to AsyncStorage
- Updates UI immediately

**`addExpenseEvent(event)`**
- Adds new event to state
- Persists to AsyncStorage

**`settleRoomBalance(roomId, userId)`**
- Finds the room
- Finds the balance for userId
- Marks `settled: true`
- Updates state and storage
- Updates summary dashboard

---

## 📐 Calculation Logic

### Room Balance Split

```typescript
const totalAmount = 1200; // e.g., rent
const allMembers = [currentUser, user1, user2]; // 3 people
const perPersonAmount = totalAmount / allMembers.length; // $400

// Creates balances for non-creators:
[
  { userId: user1.id, amount: 400, settled: false },
  { userId: user2.id, amount: 400, settled: false }
]

// Total you'll receive: $800
```

### Summary Dashboard Calculation

```typescript
balanceSummary = {
  toReceive: sum of all unsettled balances in active rooms,
  youOwe: 0 // Not implemented yet
}
```

### Individual Balances Aggregation

```typescript
// Example:
Room 1: User A owes you $400
Room 2: User A owes you $300
Room 3: User B owes you $200

Individual Balances:
- User A: $700 (owes you)
- User B: $200 (owes you)
```

## 🐛 Current Issues & Limitations

### Issue 1: Balance Calculation Bias
**Problem:** Only room creators can receive money, participants can't
**Why:** Balances only created for non-creators
**Impact:** Can't handle scenarios where someone else pays upfront

**Example:**
- Alice creates room for $1200 rent (she's creator)
- Bob and Charlie each owe Alice $400
- **But what if Bob paid for groceries $150?**
- No way to track Bob receiving money from others

### Issue 2: Mock Payment History
**Problem:** Doesn't reflect actual settlements
**Why:** Hardcoded array, not connected to `settleRoomBalance()`
**Impact:** History is inaccurate and misleading

### Issue 3: No Individual Expense Tracking
**Problem:** Can only create lump sum rooms
**Why:** No UI to add itemized expenses
**Impact:** Can't track "who paid for what"

**Example:**
- Weekend trip room created for $500
- Can't add: "Alice paid $150 for hotel"
- Can't add: "Bob paid $80 for gas"
- Just one lump sum

### Issue 4: Event-Room Relationship Not Used
**Problem:** Events exist but can't contain rooms
**Why:** No UI to link rooms to events
**Impact:** Events are just standalone containers

### Issue 5: No Audit Trail
**Problem:** Can't see history of changes
**Why:** No logging of who marked what as paid
**Impact:** Disputes are hard to resolve

### Issue 6: Local Storage Only
**Problem:** Data doesn't sync
**Why:** AsyncStorage is device-specific
**Impact:**
- Lost if app deleted
- Can't access from web
- Roommates can't see same data
