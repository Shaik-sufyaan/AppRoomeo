# Match Request System - Implementation Summary

## 🎉 What Was Implemented

We've successfully implemented a complete **approval-based matching system** with **complementary user type filtering** for your roommate-finding app. This replaces the old instant-match system with a Hinge-style approval flow.

---

## 📦 Files Created

### 1. Database Migration
**File:** `supabase/migrations/006_create_matching_system.sql`

**What it does:**
- Creates 3 new tables: `match_requests`, `matches`, and `swipes`
- Adds 5 database functions for matching logic
- Sets up Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Implements complementary user type filtering at database level

**Key features:**
- Prevents duplicate swipes/requests
- Tracks match request status (pending, approved, rejected)
- Supports mutual match detection
- 30-day request expiration

---

### 2. API Layer
**File:** `lib/api/matches.ts`

**Functions created:**
- `sendMatchRequest()` - Send match request when user swipes right
- `approveMatchRequest()` - Approve an incoming request
- `rejectMatchRequest()` - Silently reject a request
- `getReceivedMatchRequests()` - Fetch all pending requests
- `getSentMatchRequests()` - Fetch sent requests
- `getMatches()` - Get all confirmed matches
- `recordSwipe()` - Track left swipes
- `getMatchFeed()` - Get profiles filtered by user type
- `areUsersMatched()` - Check if two users are matched

**Key features:**
- Full TypeScript typing
- Error handling
- Validates complementary user types
- Detects mutual matches automatically

---

### 3. TypeScript Types
**File:** `types/index.ts` (updated)

**Types added:**
- `UserType` - "looking-for-place" | "finding-roommate"
- `MatchRequest` - Match request interface
- `MatchRequestWithUser` - Request with user profile
- `ConfirmedMatch` - Confirmed match interface
- `ConfirmedMatchWithUser` - Match with user profile
- `SwipeType` - "like" | "skip" | "reject"
- `SwipeRecord` - Swipe history

**Notification types added:**
- `match_request` - New request received
- `match_approved` - Request was approved
- `mutual_match` - Both users swiped right

---

### 4. UI Components

#### **MatchRequestCard** (`components/MatchRequestCard.tsx`)
Displays incoming match requests with:
- User profile info
- User type badge (looking-for-place / has a place)
- Approve and Reject buttons
- Loading states

#### **MatchCelebrationModal** (`components/MatchCelebrationModal.tsx`)
Shows when a match is created:
- Both user avatars
- "It's a Match!" or "Match Confirmed!" message
- Different UI for mutual matches
- "Send Message" and "Keep Swiping" buttons

#### **RejectConfirmationModal** (`components/RejectConfirmationModal.tsx`)
Confirms rejection:
- Explains rejection is silent
- Cancel and Reject buttons
- User name in message

---

### 5. Updated Matches Screen
**File:** `app/(tabs)/matches/index.tsx`

**New features:**
- **Pending Requests section** at top showing incoming requests
- **Smart filter indicator** showing which user type you're seeing
- **Real-time API integration** instead of mock data
- **Complementary matching** - only shows opposite user types
- **Match celebration modal** on successful match
- **Reject confirmation** before declining requests
- **Loading states** for better UX
- **Empty states** when no profiles available

**User experience:**
- Swipe right → sends match request
- If recipient already sent request → instant match!
- Otherwise → request appears in their "Pending Requests"
- They can approve (creates match) or reject (silent)

---

## 🎯 Key Features Implemented

### 1. Complementary User Type Matching

**The Rule:**
- `looking-for-place` users **only see** `finding-roommate` users
- `finding-roommate` users **only see** `looking-for-place` users

**Where it's enforced:**
1. **Database level:** `get_match_feed()` function filters by user type
2. **API level:** `sendMatchRequest()` validates compatibility
3. **UI level:** Smart filter message shows what you're seeing

**Benefits:**
- No incompatible matches (both looking for place, or both have place)
- Clear expectations - you know why you're seeing each profile
- Better match quality

---

### 2. Approval-Based Matching

**Flow:**
```
User A swipes right on User B
    ↓
Match request created
    ↓
User B sees request in "Pending Requests"
    ↓
User B taps "Approve"
    ↓
Match is created
    ↓
Both users can now chat
```

**Silent rejections:**
- User B can tap "Reject"
- Request is deleted
- User A is NOT notified
- Request stays in "Sent" list forever (better UX)

---

### 3. Mutual Match Detection

**Flow:**
```
User A swipes right on User B
    ↓
System checks: Did User B already swipe right on User A?
    ↓
YES: Create match immediately! 🎉
    ↓
Both users see "It's a Match!" modal
```

**No requests needed:**
- If both users swipe right, match is instant
- Both pending requests are deleted
- Match is marked as `is_mutual: true`

---

### 4. Swipe History Tracking

**What's tracked:**
- Every swipe is recorded in `swipes` table
- Types: `like` (right), `skip` (left), `reject` (declined request)

**Why it matters:**
- Prevents showing same user twice
- Analytics on user behavior
- Can implement "undo" feature later

---

## 🗂️ Database Schema

### match_requests Table
```sql
id                UUID (primary key)
sender_id         UUID (who swiped right)
recipient_id      UUID (who received request)
status            TEXT (pending/approved/rejected)
message           TEXT (optional, future feature)
created_at        TIMESTAMP

## 🚀 How to Deploy

### Step 1: Run Database Migration

**Option A: Supabase Dashboard**
1. Go to SQL Editor in Supabase Dashboard
2. Copy contents of `supabase/migrations/006_create_matching_system.sql`
3. Paste and run

**Option B: Supabase CLI**
```bash
supabase db push
```

**Verify migration:**
```sql
-- Check tables exist
SELECT tablename FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
AND tablename IN ('match_requests', 'matches', 'swipes');

-- Should return 3 rows
```

---

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

All required dependencies are already in your project:
- `@supabase/supabase-js` ✓
- `expo-router` ✓
- `lucide-react-native` ✓
- `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` ✓

No new packages needed!

---

### Step 3: Test the Flow

1. **Create two test accounts** with different user types:
   - Account A: "looking-for-place"
   - Account B: "finding-roommate"

2. **Test complementary matching:**
   - Login as Account A
   - Navigate to Matches screen
   - Verify you only see Account B (and other "finding-roommate" users)

3. **Test match request flow:**
   - Swipe right on Account B
   - See "Request sent!" message
   - Login as Account B
   - See request in "Pending Requests" section
   - Tap "Approve"
   - See match celebration modal

4. **Test mutual match:**
   - Have both users swipe right before seeing requests
   - Both should see instant match modal

5. **Test rejection:**
   - Have Account B reject a request
   - Verify Account A is not notified
   - Verify request disappears from Account B's list

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Not authenticated" error
**Solution:** Ensure user is logged in via Supabase Auth
```typescript
const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser();
console.log('Current user:', user);
```

---

### Problem: Match feed is empty
**Solutions:**
1. Check if current user has `user_type` set in profiles table
2. Verify other users exist with complementary user type
3. Check if all users have been swiped/matched already
4. Look at database logs for function errors

```sql
-- Check current user's type
SELECT id, name, user_type FROM profiles WHERE id = 'your-user-id';

-- Check available users
SELECT id, name, user_type FROM profiles
WHERE user_type != 'your-user-type' AND is_visible = true;
```

---

### Problem: RLS policy errors
**Solution:** Grant permissions after running migration
```sql
GRANT ALL ON match_requests TO authenticated;
GRANT ALL ON matches TO authenticated;
GRANT ALL ON swipes TO authenticated;
GRANT EXECUTE ON ALL FUNCTIONS IN SCHEMA public TO authenticated;
```

---

### Problem: "Incompatible user types" error
**Cause:** Trying to match users with same user type

**Check:**
```sql
SELECT
  a.name as user_a,
  a.user_type as type_a,
  b.name as user_b,
  b.user_type as type_b
FROM profiles a, profiles b
WHERE a.id = 'user-a-id' AND b.id = 'user-b-id';
```

Should show different user types (one `looking-for-place`, one `finding-roommate`)

---

## 📊 Analytics Queries

### Match request statistics
```sql
SELECT
  status,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM match_requests
GROUP BY status;
```

### Mutual match rate
```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(CASE WHEN is_mutual THEN 1 END) as mutual_matches,
  COUNT(*) as total_matches,
  ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(CASE WHEN is_mutual THEN 1 END) / COUNT(*), 2) as mutual_rate
FROM matches;
```

### Swipe patterns
```sql
SELECT
  swipe_type,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM swipes
GROUP BY swipe_type;
```

### User compatibility check
```sql
SELECT
  a.user_type as type_a,
  b.user_type as type_b,
  are_users_compatible(a.id, b.id) as compatible
FROM profiles a, profiles b
WHERE a.id != b.id
LIMIT 10;
```
